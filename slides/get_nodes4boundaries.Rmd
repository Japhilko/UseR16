## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,cache=T)
```

## A function to get the nodes in a boundary

```{r}
nodes4boundaries <- function(object,boundary){
  Link1 <- "http://www.overpass-api.de/api/interpreter?data="
  InfoList <- xmlParse(paste0(Link1,"node[",object,"](",boundary,");out;"))
  return(InfoList)  
}
```



## Code underlying my presentation in Stanford

Get nodes for a certain boundary

```{r}
library(XML)
object <- "leisure=playground"
boundary <- "50.6,7.0,50.8,7.3"
pg_C <- nodes4boundaries(object,boundary)
```

## How the result looks like

```{r}
head(pg_C)
```
