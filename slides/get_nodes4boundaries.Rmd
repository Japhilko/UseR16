## A function to get the nodes in a boundary

```{r}
nodes4boundaries <- function(object,boundary){
  Link1 <- "http://www.overpass-api.de/api/interpreter?data="
  InfoList <- xmlParse(paste0(Link1,"node[",object,"](",boundary,");out;"))
  return(InfoList)  
}
```



## Code underlying my presentation in Stanford

Get nodes for a certain boundary

- Values for the bounding box: South-West-North-East

```{r}
library(XML)
object <- "leisure=playground"
boundary <- "50.6,7.0,50.8,7.3"
pg_C <- nodes4boundaries(object,boundary)
```

## How the result looks like

```{r}
head(pg_C)
```
